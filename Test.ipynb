    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class), along with restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data hiding is the practice of restricting access to an object’s internal state. Encapsulation achieves this by using access control (public vs private) and exposing a controlled interface (getters/setters, methods). In many languages, true private access modifiers exist; in Python, name mangling with double underscores plus convention (single underscore) provides a practical hiding mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life example: A community water-sharing system where each household’s water allocation is stored as a value. Encapsulation ensures that the allocation (data) can only be read or updated through a controlled interface (e.g., a setter that validates the new allocation). This prevents accidental or malicious misuse, such as setting a negative allocation or exceeding limits, safeguarding fair access and resource stewardship."

    "\n",
    "Real-time Data and Traceability: Every visit is immediately logged, providing real-time traceability. This is crucial during emergencies, disciplinary actions, or security concerns, as administrators can instantly verify who was in the hostel and when.\n",

    "Accountability of Students and Visitors: The log holds both the resident student and their visitor accountable for the visit. The associated timestamp, student ID, and visitor details create a clear, auditable trail. Any breach of visitor policy can be quickly investigated and attributed to the responsible parties.\n",

    "Mobile Money System Security and Trust\n",
    "A Mobile Money platform (like M-Pesa or MoMo) relies on encapsulation to maintain user trust and prevent fraud. User balances are stored in a private variable (_balance) within a secure Wallet class. Public interactions, such as withdraw() or deposit(), are the only way to change this data. These public methods encapsulate the crucial business logic—like checking the user's PIN, ensuring the transaction amount is positive, verifying sufficient funds, and enforcing transaction limits (a district rule). By restricting direct access to the balance, encapsulation ensures that all changes are legitimate and validated, safeguarding the user's money and the system's integrity.\n",
